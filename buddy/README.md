# Buddy Integration

## Overview
Buddy is a continuous integration automation platform that can be used to build, test, and deploy web sites and applications. 

The Buddy integration enables you to:

- Send events about your Buddy deployments to Datadog.
- Correlate deployment details with your Datadog metrics.
- Detect sources of performance spikes in your pipelines.

## Setup

- In your Datadog account settings go to [Integrations -> APIs][2] and copy the **API Key** token.

- [Sign in to your Buddy account][3] and go to the pipeline with the deployment action that you want to track.

- Click the plus at the end of the pipeline and select **Datadog** in the **Notifications** section.

- Enter the name of your Datadog account and paste the API key that you copied.

- Use [Buddy parameters][4] to define the title of the event and content sent, for example:

```text
# Event title
${'${execution.pipeline.name} execution #${execution.id}'}

# Content
${'${execution.to_revision.revision} - ${execution.to_revision.message}'}
```

- When ready, click **Add action** and run the pipeline. On every successful deployment, Buddy sends an event to Datadog:
