# Agent Check: AWS Pricing

## Overview

This check pulls pricing information [published by AWS][1] to make it easier to measure cost of resource utilization within Datadog.

## Setup

The AWS Pricing check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the AWS Pricing check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-aws_pricing==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `aws_pricing.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting AWS pricing data. See the sample [aws_pricing.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `aws_pricing` under the Checks section.
