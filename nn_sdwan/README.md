# Agent Check: Netnology's Cisco SD-WAN Integration

## Overview

This check monitors Cisco SD-WAN controllers through the Datadog Agent using an SD-WAN platform provided by [Netnology][1]. The
check enables users to monitor the network health and performance of multiple Cisco SD-WAN controllers simultaneously. Collected
information can then be used for aggregated dashboarding and notifications on configured monitors/alerts.

Currently, only Cisco vManage devices are supported as SD-WAN controller targets.

## Setup

The Netnology Cisco SD-WAN integration is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it manually.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][10] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ``` bash
   datadog-agent integration install -t nn_sdwan==1.0.1
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][3].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `nn_sdwan.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Cisco SD-WAN performance data. See [sample nn_sdwan.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `nn_sdwan` under the Checks section.
