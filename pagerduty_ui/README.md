# PagerDuty

## Overview

PagerDuty is a real-time operations platform which is continuously processing, analyzing,
and routing event data. The system acts as an aggregation point for data coming from multiple
monitoring tools and can provide a holistic view of your current state of operations. PagerDuty
allows Datadog customers to enable more effective incident response while increasing visibility
and accountability throughout the incident lifecycle. PagerDuty delivers two new apps that will
give you all the capabilities of our real-time operations platform, wherever you work
without the need to switch tools. Add new widgets, Status Dashboard by PagerDuty
and Incidents by PagerDuty, directly to your dashboard to see the service status dashboard and respond
to high-urgency incidents directly from Datadog in real time.

### Status Dashboard by PagerDuty

Status Dashboard by PagerDuty provides technical responders, business responders,
and technical and business leaders a live, shared view of system health to improve
awareness of operational issues. It displays the current service status and sends
notifications to alert users when business services are being impacted. This feature
improves communication between response teams and stakeholders during incidents.

#### Key Features

- Teams can view the service status dashboard directly from Datadog to get a quick, real-time view of their team's system health.

Datadog interface. It arms you with knowledge of ongoing incidents within PagerDuty
along with the ability to acknowledge and resolve all with a seamless navigation back into
PagerDuty without having to context switch between tools.
