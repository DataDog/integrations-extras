# Agent Check: IsDown

## Overview

[IsDown][1] is a status page aggregator and outage monitoring tool that helps businesses monitor their dependencies. You can provide your team real-time monitoring and instant notifications for outages in all your tools and cloud providers. IsDown monitors more than 2000 status pages.

With this integration, you can receive alerts from third-party dependencies in Datadog, monitor business critical services, and understand the frequency of outages all within the out-of-the-box dashboard.

## Setup

1. Use your existing account or create a new one in [IsDown][1].
2. Log in to your account and go to the **Notifications** page.
3. Click on the checkbox to select Datadog and then click **Connect to Datadog**.
4. You are then redirected to Datadog to authorize the application. IsDown creates an API key that only has access to what IsDown needs to send events and service checks to Datadog.
5. After authorization you are redirected to IsDown.
6. Select the services to monitor.
7. Configure any desired notification settings for each service.


### Uninstallation

1. Go to the **Notifications** page in IsDown.

3. Ensure that all API keys associated with this integration have been disabled by searching for IsDown on the [API Keys management page][4] in Datadog.


## Data Collected

### Service Checks

See [service_checks.json][3] for a list of service checks provided by this integration.

- Tags: `isdown` and `isdown:service_name`.
