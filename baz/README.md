# Baz

## Overview
Baz helps developers write unbreakable code by:
1. Identifying what the code represents, and part of what application / platform it operates in.
2. Identifying dependencies and the possible impact a code change may bring.
3. Bringing all this context into the review process and making it 100x more collaborative and constructive.

## Setup

### Installation

Visit [baz.co][1] and sign up. Once registered, visit the [Datadog integration page][2] and add a Datadog integration. This guides you through the Datadog OAUTH2 flow to grant Baz access to your billing and usage data.

### Configuration

Once integrated, you will see the integration with its status in the [Datadog integration page][2].

### Uninstallation

Visit the [Datadog integration page][2] and click the "Remove" trash button to uninstall the integration.

## Data Collected

Baz collects APM metrics - traces, spans and services, to get the app context so missing in today's code reading and reviewing.
