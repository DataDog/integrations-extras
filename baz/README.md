# Baz

## Overview
Baz helps developers write unbreakable code by:
1. Identifying what the code does and in what part of the application or platform it operates in.
2. Identifying dependencies and the possible impact a code change might cause.
3. Bringing the above information into the review process and making it more collaborative and constructive.

## Setup

### Installation

Visit [baz.co][1] and sign up. After you have registered, navigate to the [Datadog integration page][2] and then add the Datadog integration. It guides you through the Datadog OAuth2 setup flow to grant Baz access to your billing and usage data.

### Configuration

After the integration is set up, the integration with its status is shown on the [Datadog integration page][2].

### Uninstallation

Navigate to the [Datadog integration page][2], and then click the trash icon to uninstall the integration.

## Data Collected

Baz collects APM metrics on traces, spans and services, to provide information on your apps during code reviews.
