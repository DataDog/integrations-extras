## Overview

Kameleoon empowers teams to manage and optimize feature releases across web, mobile, and server-side applications with precision.

Integrate with Datadog RUM to monitor feature deployments and releases with real-time performance data, helping you understand the direct impact of specific features on user behavior and application metrics.

## Setup

Feature flag tracking is available in the RUM Browser SDK. For detailed set up instructions, visit [Getting started with feature flag data in RUM][1].

1. Update your Browser RUM SDK version to 4.25.0 or above.
2. Initialize the RUM SDK and configure the `enableExperimentalFeatures` initialization parameter with `["feature_flags"]`.
3. Initialize [Kameleoon's SDK][2] and define an `onEvent` handler to watch `Evaluation` events.

```javascript
client.onEvent(EventType.Evaluation, ({ featureKey, variation }) => {
  datadogRum.addFeatureFlagEvaluation(featureKey, variation.key);
});
```
