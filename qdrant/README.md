# Qdrant

## Overview

[Qdrant][1] is a high-performance vector search engine and vector database. With this integration, you can get real-time metrics to monitor your Qdrant deployment within Datadog including:

- The performance of REST and gRPC interfaces with metrics such as total requests, total failures, and time to serve to identify potential bottlenecks and mitigate them.
- Information about the readiness of the cluster, and deployment (total peers, pending operations, etc.) to gain insights into your Qdrant deployment.

For a full list of supported metrics, see the **Metrics** section below.

## Setup

The Qdrant check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Qdrant check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t qdrant==1.0.0
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `qdrant.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Qdrant [metrics](#metrics).

Most importantly, set the `openmetrics_endpoint` value to the [`/metrics` endpoint](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/monitoring/#monitoring) of your Qdrant instance.

```yaml
instances:
    ## @param openmetrics_endpoint - string - optional
    ## The URL exposing metrics in the OpenMetrics format.
  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://localhost:6333/metrics
```

If the Qdrant instance requires authentication, you can specify the token by configuring [`extra_headers`](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/blob/26f9ae7660f042c43f5d771f0c937ff805cf442c/openmetrics/datadog_checks/openmetrics/data/conf.yaml.example#L553C1-L558C35).

```yaml
# @param extra_headers - mapping - optional
# Additional headers to send with every request.
extra_headers:
   api-key: <QDRANT_API_KEY>
```

2. [Restart the Agent][9]

## Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `qdrant` under the Checks section.
