# Sortdb Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from [Sortdb][1] service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor Sortdb stats.
- Be notified about Sortdb failovers.
- Check health of and get stats from multiple instances

## Setup

The Sortdb check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Sortdb check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-sortdb==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `sortdb.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Sortdb [metrics](#metric-collection). See the [sample sortdb.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][9].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `sortdb` under the Checks section.

## Compatibility

The SortDB check is compatible with all major platforms.
