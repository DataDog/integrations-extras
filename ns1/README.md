## Setup

The NS1 check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the NS1 check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-ns1==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `ns1.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting NS1 metrics. See the sample [ns1.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][4] and look for `ns1` under the Checks section.
