# Agent Check: Cloudsmith

## Overview

This check monitors [Cloudsmith][1] through the Datadog Agent.
- Monitor storage, bandwidth and token usage in your Cloudsmith account. 


## Setup

The Cloudsmith check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Cloudsmith check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-cloudsmith==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `cloudsmith.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Cloudsmith performance data. See the [sample cloudsmith.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `cloudsmith` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][8] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

See [service_checks.json][9] for a list of service checks provided by this integration.

### Events

All Cloudsmith related events collected appear within the Datadog Event Stream with the `source:cloudsmith` property. They are collected every five minutes to reduce the number of requests sent to the Cloudsmith API.

There are two types of events:

- Security Scan event
- Audit Logs event

They are accessible with aggregation keys: `@aggregation_key:audit_log` and `@aggregation_key:vulnerabilities`.
