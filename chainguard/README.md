# Chainguard

## Overview

Chainguard allows developers to reduce engineering toil associated with managing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), build on a secure foundation of open-source software, and streamline compliance across the company against business-critical frameworks like FedRAMP, PCI-DSS, SOC2, and others. Our product, Chainguard Containers, is minimal, contains zero CVEs, and comes equipped with guarded protection under our remediation SLA. All 1200+ of our images are built from source and are regularly scanned and patched for CVEs.

This integration includes an out-of-the-box dashboard that displays existing containers eligible for migration to Chainguard Containers. You can quickly see long-running containers that may be nearing end-of-life and need to be updated to a secure container. Additionally, if you're a customer of CSM Infrastructure Vulnerabilities, you can see which containers have the highest number ofÂ  CVEs, indicating they should be migrated to Chainguard sooner.

## Setup

The out-of-the-box dashboard automatically queries existing Docker container metrics collected by the Datadog Agent. No additional setup is required.

To start using a Chainguard Image, visit [Chainguard Images][1], find your desired image, and follow the instructions to pull it.

## Uninstallation

To remove the out-of-the-box dashboard, go to the Chainguard integration tile, navigate to the Configure tab, and click **Uninstall Integration**.

To uninstall a Chainguard Image, remove all references to it in your configuration and revert to the original image.
