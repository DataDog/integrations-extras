# Agent Check: Sonarr

## Overview

This check monitors [Sonarr][1].


## Setup

The Sonarr check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Sonarr check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-sonarr==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `sonarr.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Sonarr performance data. See the [sample sonarr.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `sonarr` under the Checks section.
