# Agent Check: PerimeterX

## Overview

This integration allows [PerimeterX][2] customers to forward their PerimeterX related logs and events to Datadog.

## Setup

All configuration is done by PerimeterX. See the [PerimeterX documentation][3] regarding third party integrations.

### Installation

No installation is required on your host.

### Configuration

1. Generate a new Integration API Key in your [Datadog portal][4].
2. Open a support ticket with [PerimeterX Support][5] and request the Datadog log export integration. Support needs the following information:
   - Your Datadog Integration API Key
   - Whether you want to send metrics and/or logs
   - The PerimeterX Application ID(s) that should be forwarded to Datadog

### Validation

Once PerimeterX Support has confirmed the Datadog integration is complete, perform the following steps to confirm the integration is working as expected:

1. Login to your Datadog portal.
2. Navigate to Logs -> Search
3. Perform a search with a query filter of "Source:perimeterx"
4. Confirm you are receiving logs from PerimeterX (it may take a few minutes before logs start appearing).
