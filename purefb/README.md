# Agent Check: PureFB

## Overview

This check monitors the [Pure Storage FlashBlade][3] through the [Datadog Agent][2] and the [Pure Storage FlashBlade OpenMetrics exporter][1]. 

The integration can provide performance data at the array, client, share, and bucket level, as well as high-level capacity and configuration information.

You can monitor multiple FlashBlades and aggregate these into a single dashboard, or group them together by customer-defined environment.

**This integration requires the following**:

 - FlashBlade Purity 4.1.x+
 - Datadog Agent v7.26.x+ to use OpenMetricsBaseCheckV2
 - Python 3
 - The Pure Storage FlashBlade OpenMetrics exporter v1.0.11+ is installed and running in a containerized environment. Refer to the [Pure Storage GitHub repo][1] for installation instructions.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][13] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

1. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][9].
2. Manually install the Pure FlashBlade integration. See [Use Community Integrations][10] for more details based on your environment.


#### Host

To configure this check for an Agent running on a host, run `datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-purefb==2.0.0`.


### Configuration

1. Create a user on your FlashBlade with the Read-Only role and generate an API token for this user.

2. Add the following configuration block to the `purefb.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory, to start collecting your PureFB performance data. See the sample [purefb.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

**Note**: The `/array` endpoint is required as an absolute minimum when creating your configuration file.

```yaml
init_config:
   timeout: 120

instances:

  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://<exporter_ip_or_fqdn>:<port>/metrics/array?endpoint=<array_ip_or_fqdn>
    tags:
       - env:<env>
       - fb_array_name:<full_fqdn>
       - host:<full_fqdn>
    headers:
       Authorization: Bearer <api_token>
    min_collection_interval: 120

  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://<exporter_ip_or_fqdn>:<port>/metrics/clients?endpoint=<array_ip_or_fqdn>
    tags:
       - env:<env>
       - fb_array_name:<full_fqdn>
       - host:<full_fqdn>
    headers:
       Authorization: Bearer <api_token>
    min_collection_interval: 600

  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://<exporter_ip_or_fqdn>:<port>/metrics/usage?endpoint=<array_ip_or_fqdn>
    tags:
       - env:<env>
       - fb_array_name:<full_fqdn>
       - host:<full_fqdn>
    headers:
       Authorization: Bearer <api_token>
    min_collection_interval: 600

```

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `purefb` under the Checks section.

### Troubleshooting

#### Arrays are not showing in dashboard

The dashboards included in this integration use the tags `env`, `host`, and `fb_array_name`. Make sure that these are set per instance.

```yaml
 tags:
    - env:<env>
    - fb_array_name:<full_fqdn>
    - host:<full_fqdn>
```

#### Increasing collection interval

For the `/array` endpoint, the Pure Storage FlashBlade check sets `min_collection_interval` to `120` by default, and the minimum recommended value is `15`. You may increase or decrease `min_collection_interval` in the `purefb.d/conf.yaml` file if necessary:

```yaml
min_collection_interval: 120
```

For the `/clients`, and `/usage` endpoints, the Pure Storage FlashBlade check sets `min_collection_interval` to `600` by default , and the minimum recommended value is `120`. You may increase or decrease `min_collection_interval` in the `purefb.d/conf.yaml` file if necessary:

```yaml
min_collection_interval: 600
```
