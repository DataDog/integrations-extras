## Overview
[EMnify][1] is a cellular IoT connectivity platform that keeps devices
connected and secure.

Use the Datadog-EMnify integration to collect metrics and data usage from IoT EMnify devices.

## Setup
Follow the [EMnify integration guide][2] to configure streaming of usage data, using the **Integration steps** and **Verifying the integration** sections.

### Monitors

Everybody has different usage patterns, so in order for monitors to reflect your specific case you must
define workload-based boundaries and sensitivity.
For more information read the [Forecast monitor][4] and [Anomaly monitor][5] documentation.

### Dashboard
