# Agent Check: celerdata

## Overview

[CelerData][1] is the enterprise version of the open source OLAP database StarRocks.  StarRocks/CelerData is designed for low latency analytics directly on your data lake house.

This integration allows users to collect metrics and logs. By leveraging this integration, customers can gain insights into query performance, system health, and resource utilization, enabling them to have visibility into the database.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][2] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

To collect StarRocks [metrics][9] and logs:

1. Download and install the [Datadog Agent][8].
2. Install the CelerData check on your host with the following command:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-celerdata==1.0.0
   ```

### Configuration

1. Edit the `celerdata.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory, to start collecting metrics and logs. See the [celerdata.d/conf.yaml.example][3] for all available configuration options.

2. Datadog listens on port 5000 for the `dogstatsd_stats_port` and `expvar_port`. In your `celerdata.conf` file, you will need to change the `server.discovery.listen_address` and the `server.discovery.advertised_address` to use a port other than 5000.

3. [Restart the Agent][4].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][5] and look for `celerdata` under the Checks section.
