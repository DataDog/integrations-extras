# Agent Check: Nomad

![Nomad Dashboard][4]

## Overview

Gather metrics from your Nomad clusters to:

- Visualize and monitor cluster performance
- Alert on cluster health and availability

Recommended monitors are available to get notified on different Nomad events.

## Setup

### Installation

Nomad emits metrics to Datadog through DogStatsD. To enable the Nomad integration, [install the Datadog Agent][1] on each client and server host.

### Configuration

Once the Datadog Agent is installed, add a Telemetry stanza to the Nomad configuration for your clients and servers:

```conf
telemetry {
  publish_allocation_metrics = true
  publish_node_metrics       = true
  datadog_address = "localhost:8125"
  disable_hostname = true
  collection_interval = "10s"
}
```

Next, reload or restart the Nomad agent on each host. You should start to see Nomad metrics flowing to your Datadog account.
