# Vespa Integration

## Overview

Gather metrics from your [Vespa][1] system in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor Vespa state and performance
- Alert on health and availability

## Setup

The Vespa check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Vespa check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-vespa==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

To configure the Vespa check:

1. Create a `vespa.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][8].
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in the `vespa.d/` folder previously created.
3. See the [sample vespa.d/conf.yaml][10] file and copy its content in the `conf.yaml` file.
4. Edit the `conf.yaml` file to configure the `consumer`, which decides the set of metrics forwarded by the check:
   - `consumer`: The consumer to collect metrics for, either `default` or a [custom consumer][9]
     from your Vespa application's services.xml.
5. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `vespa` under the Checks section.
