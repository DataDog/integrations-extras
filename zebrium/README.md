# Zebrium Root Cause as a Service
 
## Overview
 
When you know there's a problem and you're not sure what caused it, [Zebrium][1] shows you the root cause directly on your Datadog dashboards. It works by using machine learning on logs, without the need for manual training or setting up any rules, and it achieves accuracy in less than 24 hours. 

## Setup
 
The Zebrium events and metrics integration uses a [Datadog API key][2], which needs to be created by a Datadog admin. Once you obtain a Datadog API key, see the [Zebrium documentation for Datadog integration][3] to learn how to setup the Zebrium events and metrics integration for Datadog.
