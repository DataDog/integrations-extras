# Chainguard Images Overview

## Overview

The Chainguard Images dashboard shows existing containers which can be migrated to Chainguard images. All Chainguard Images are minimal, contain zero CVEs and come equipped with guarded protection under our remediation SLA.

## Setup

The Chainguard Images Overview dashboard is available without any setup needed. The dashboard queries your existing Docker container metrics to visualize the data. 

In order to get started with a Chainguard Image, find your image in https://images.chainguard.dev/ and follow the directions to pull it

## Uninstallation

There are no uninstallation steps needed since the Chainguard Images Overview dashboard queries your existing Docker container metrics. 

On order to uninstall a Chainguard Image you're using, please remove all references to your Chainguard Image and revert back to the original image
