# Chainguard

## Overview

This integration includes an out-of-the-box dashboard that displays existing containers eligible for migration to Chainguard Containers. All Chainguard Containers are minimal, contain zero CVEs and come equipped with guarded protection under our remediation SLA. Additionally, Chainguard Containers are built from source code and scanned for CVEs regularly. 

## Setup

The included out-of-the-box dashboard automatically queries existing Docker container metrics collected by the Datadog Agent. No additional setup is required.

To start using a Chainguard Image, visit [Chainguard Images][1], find your desired image, and follow the instructions to pull it.

## Uninstallation

To remove the out-of-the-box dashboard, go to the Chainguard integration tile, navigate to the Configure tab, and click **Uninstall Integration**.

To uninstall a Chainguard Image, remove all references to it in your configuration and revert to the original image.
