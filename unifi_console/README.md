# Agent Check: Unifi Console

## Overview

This check monitors [Unifi Console][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

The Unifi check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Unifi check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   sudo -u dd-agent -- datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-unifi_console==1.2.0
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `unifi_console.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Unifi Console performance data. See the [sample unifi_console.d/conf.yaml][11] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `unifi_console` under the Checks section.
