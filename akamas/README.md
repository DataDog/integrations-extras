# Akamas

## Overview

Akamas Insights helps developers, DevOps engineers, and SREs quickly identify cost inefficiencies and reliability issues in Kubernetes environments. It collects observability data from Datadog and analyzes workloads, application runtimes like the JVM and cluster behaviour to automatically identify optimization opportunities and generate easy-to-apply recommendations.

**Cost Efficiency Analysis**
detect issues like over-provisioned workloads, over-sized JVM heap memory, or inefficient cluster autoscaling behavior and estimate savings, so that you can focus on the biggest cost reduction opportunities.

**Reliability Risk Detection**
Identifies risks like CPU throttling, out-of-memory kills or wrong JVM configurations that can cause out of memory kills or performance issues, so that you can fix the problem before they cause a production issue.

**Compliance Issues Identification**
Detect issues like pods with no memory limits or JVM with default settings, so that you can educate all application teams using Kubernetes about configuration best practices to achieve efficiency and reliable applications.

Akamas Insights delivers actionable recommendations that uniquely cover the full Kubernetes stack, including the pod resources, JVM options and providing visibility around cluster autoscaling efficiency. It requires no agents or other changes, making it easy to adopt within any existing Kubernetes environment.
