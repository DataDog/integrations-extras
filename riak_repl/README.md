# Agent Check: Riak-Repl

## Overview

This check monitors Riak replication [riak-repl][1].

## Setup

The Riak-Repl check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Riak-Repl check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-riak_repl==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `riak_repl.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your riak_repl performance data. See the [sample riak_repl.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][8]

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][9] and look for `riak_repl` under the Checks section.
