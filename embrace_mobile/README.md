# Embrace Mobile

## Overview

### What is Embrace?

[Embrace][1] is a mobile observability and data platform that empowers mobile teams to deliver optimal user experiences for 
performance optimization, issue prioritization and remediation, and monitoring across features, releases, and custom 
segments. At its core, Embrace turns complex mobile data into action. By collecting comprehensive session-level data for
each and every user experience, Embrace extracts powerful insights to fuel your growth.

After integration installation, Embrace provides dashboards that track key mobile health metrics. For any regression, you can inspect 
the full details of every affected user session without having to manually reproduce it.
