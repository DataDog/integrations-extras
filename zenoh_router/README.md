# Agent Check: Zenoh router

## Overview

This check monitors Zenoh router.

[Zenoh][1] is an open source Zero Overhead Network Protocol.

Zenoh (/zeno/) is a pub/sub/query protocol unifying data in motion, data at rest, and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed storage, queries, and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

The Zenoh router integration allows you to monitor router metrics and router/peer/client connection statuses in Datadog.

## Setup

### Installation with the Datadog Agent (v7.21+ and v6.21+)

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install Zenoh router check on your host.

1. On your host, run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-zenoh_router==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

Note:
- The datadog-zenoh_router integration version 1.0.0 is compatible with Zenoh router versions below 1.0.
- For Zenoh router versions above or equal 1.0, integration version 1.1.0 should be used.

### Installation from the source code

To install the Zenoh router check on your host:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][11] on any machine.

2. Run `ddev release build zenoh_router` to build the package.

3. Upload the build artifact to any host with [the Agent installed][3]

4. On the host, run `datadog-agent integration install -w path/to/zenoh_router/dist/<ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl`.

### Configuration

1. Make sure that the [Zenoh REST API plugin][2] is enabled.

Note:
- The default Zenoh router provides only session information. 
- To access full statistics, this feature needs to be enabled at Zenoh router build time using the stats feature. For example:
```shell
cargo build --features stats
```
Alternatively, you can use routers from the [Zetta Platform][12]

2. Edit the `zenoh_router.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][10] to start collecting your Zenoh router [metrics](#metrics).
See the [sample zenoh_router.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

3. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `zenoh_router` under the Checks section.
