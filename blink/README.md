# BlinkOps Integration

## Overview

The [Blink][1] integration is a collection of no-code actions and triggers usable in Blink Automations. Instead of writing manual API calls and scripts, you can use Blink's visual editor to drag-and-drop Datadog API actions into your workflow. You can use also one of the hundreds of existing pre-made automations from the [library][2].

This integration enables you to:
1. Trigger automations within Blink in response to new Datadog incidents 
2. Create and update Datadog incidents in Blink 
3. View incidents or events from the Datadog event stream in Blink

View our full list of actions and capabilities on the [documentation site][3].

## Setup

Visit [our documentation][4] for details on how to connect your Datadog workspace to Blink.

## Data Collected

### Events

This integration sends events and incidents to Datadog where you can search and update any relevant incidents within Blink. 

### Monitors

You can view, modify, and create Datadog monitors in Blink.

### Metrics

Blink does not include any metrics, however you can query and list metrics from your Datadog environment for use in Blink automations.
