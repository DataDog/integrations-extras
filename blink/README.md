# BlinkOps Integration

## Overview

[Blink][1] is a low-code/no-code (LCNC) platform that enables automated incident response, cloud-native operations, and security operations workflows. Blink transforms manual tasks into interactive automations backed by the security and reliability of a cloud-native platform. Every script or ticket becomes a fully-managed automation.

The user interface and [automation library][2] come with premade Datadog-based automations and use-cases. Blink helps you achieve better cloud efficiency and more competitive SLA's, with fewer operational bottlenecks.

This out-of-the-box integration enables you to:

- Trigger event-based Blink automations using Datadog incidents.
- Create and update Datadog incidents automatically from within Blink.
- View incidents or events from the Datadog Events Explorer in Blink.
- Automatically enrich and remediate Datadog incidents using Blink automations.

For more information about Blink, see the [Blink documentation][3].

## Setup

Visit [our documentation][4] for details on how to connect your Datadog workspace to Blink.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the integration, simply delete the corresponding Datadog connection in your Blink workspace.

Once deleted, any previous authorizations or access tokens are revoked.

## Data Collected

### Events

This integration sends events and incidents to Datadog where you can search and update any relevant incidents within Blink. 

### Monitors

You can view, modify, and create Datadog monitors in Blink.

### Metrics

Blink does not include any metrics, however you can query and list metrics from your Datadog environment for use in Blink automations.
