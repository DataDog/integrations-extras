# Orus Group DD-IMPORTER

## Overview

As enterprises migrate to cloud platforms like AWS, monitoring dynamic and distributed resources becomes increasingly complex. Traditional monitoring tools, designed for static environments, struggle to handle the rapid creation, modification, and termination of cloud resources, leading to issues like inconsistent visibility, operational inefficiency, and alert fatigue. AWS Cloudwatch, while offering basic monitoring, has limitations such as single-threshold alarms, no support for multi-cloud environments, a cumbersome interface, and required AWS access, making it inadequate for enterprise cloud operations. The Orus Group's Cloudwatch to Datadog Alarm Importer (DD-Importer) addresses these challenges by deploying monitors into Datadog using structured tagging and automatic deployment to produce optimized monitoring efficiency. This innovative product automatically deploys monitors that match your AWS resources with no coding and no API keys required.  Using our app allows you to setup your monitors in minutes.

## Setup

DD-IMPORTER is designed for use with no coding and no API keys required.  Our app provides uses with pre-designed monitors for many AWS services.  You can edit and tailor the recommended monitors to your desired settings using Microsoft Excel.  When you're ready, just click the "Generate Monitors" button and upload your monitors directory into Datadog through the DD-IMPORTER app.  

 NOTE: we do not save your monitors or ever know your login credentials. 

## Uninstallation

There is nothing to install or un-install.  We do not save your monitors or ever know your login credentials.
