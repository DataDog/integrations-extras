# LoadRunner Professional

## Overview

OpenText LoadRunner Professional is a load testing solution that enables you to test the performance of diverse application types to identify and resolve issues before applications go live.

LoadRunner Controller is a tool for creating and controlling LoadRunner Professional scenarios. A scenario defines the events that occur during each testing session. It controls the number of users to emulate (virtual users, or Vusers), the actions they perform, and the machines on which they run their emulations. You use scenarios to create load tests to check the reliability and strength of your servers.

With this integration, Controller pushes real-time metrics and data from scenario runs to Datadog.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|__Send scenario information__| Send information about the scenario run, such as the start and stop time, duration and included scripts in the form of logs.
|__Send run information__| Send metrics from the scenario run, such as Vuser status and transaction response times. |

## Setup

Configure LoadRunner Controller to push data to Datadog. You can choose whether to send scenario information, run metrics, or both. Once configured, this integration provides a Datadog dashboard to view the data in pre-configured widgets.

1.  Open Controller.
2.	In the Controller toolbar, select __Tools > Datadog Configuration__.
3.	In the __Site__ field, select your [Datadog site][6].
4.	In the __API Key__ field, enter the [API key][7] generated by Datadog.
5.	Click __Test Connection__.
6.	Once the connection is successful, choose whether to send scenario information, run information, or both to Datadog.
7.	If you enable Controller to send scenario information, the included log pipeline with this integration automatically processes your logs and adds relevant tags. For more specifics on the pipeline, navigate to Logs > Pipelines in Datadog.
8.	In Datadog, the __LoadRunner Stats__ dashboard will automatically be installed with the integration. The dashboard includes widgets that display run information and scenario information (depending on the data that Controller is configured to send).

Once Controller has been configured to push data to Datadog, the data is pushed each time you run a scenario in Controller. To disable Controller from pushing data to Datadog, select __Tools > Datadog Configuration__ and clear the fields in the Datadog Configuration dialog box.
