# Portworx Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Portworx service in real time to:

- Monitor health and performance of your Portworx Cluster
- Track disk usage, latency and throughput for Portworx volumes

## Setup

The Portworx check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Portworx check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-portworx==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `portworx.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][6] to start collecting your Portworx [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample portworx.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
     # url of the metrics endpoint of prometheus
     - prometheus_endpoint: http://localhost:9001/metrics
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][8]

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand][9], you should see something like the following:

## Compatibility

The Portworx check is compatible with Portworx 1.4.0 and possible earlier versions.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][10] for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events

The Portworx check does not include any events.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot connect

```text
    portworx
    -------
      - instance #0 [ERROR]: "('Connection aborted.', error(111, 'Connection refused'))"
      - Collected 0 metrics, 0 events & 0 service check
```

Check that the `url` in `portworx.yaml` is correct.
