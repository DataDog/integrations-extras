## Overview

Discord is a communication app that lets people connect with each other through text, voice, and video calls. By integrating Datadog with Discord using webhooks, you can receive notifications and never miss an important event.

## Setup

1. Follow Discord's [instructions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) on how to create a webhook to send notifications to a specific channel.

2. Navigate to the [webhook integration tile](https://app.datadoghq.com/integrations/webhooks) in Datadog. Click **New** in the Webhooks section under the **Configuration** tab.

3. Name your webhook and paste the URL you copied from Discord. **Note**: You do not need to add an authentication method.

4. You can customize your payload or copy and paste the template below. See the [webhook documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/webhooks/#usage) for more details on the available variables.

```json
{
   "embeds":[
      {
         "title":"$EVENT_TITLE",
         "description":"$EVENT_MSG",
         "url":"$LINK",
         "color":"3407966",
         "image":{
            "url":"$SNAPSHOT"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
