# Agent Check: Fiddler

## Overview
Fiddler's Model Performance Management platform monitors Machine Learning model performance by sending real-time alerts when model performance metrics drop, allowing users to analyze inference data to understand why model performance is degrading. This integration includes metrics and an out-of-the-box dashboard that displays performance metrics such as accuracy, traffic, and drift.


## Setup

The Fiddler check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Fiddler check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-fiddler==3.0.0
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to Agent-based [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `fiddler.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Fiddler performance data. See the [sample `fiddler.d/conf.yaml`][5] for all available configuration options. The `url`, `org`, and `fiddler_api_key` parameters need to be updated for the Fiddler environment you wish the integration to query. Fiddler also suggests setting the `minimum_collection_interval` setting in the `conf.yaml` file to `300` (5 minutes).

2. [Restart the Agent][6].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][7] and look for `fiddler` under the Checks section.
