# Agent Check: Aqua

## Overview

This check monitors [Aqua][1].

The Aqua check will alert the user if total high-severity vulnerability is reached, or if a container is running inside a host not registered by Aqua. Aqua will also send data alerts regarding blocked events in runtime, and it is possible to trigger a webhook to scale infrastructure if more Aqua scanners are required.

## Setup

The Aqua check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Aqua check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-aqua==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

#### Metric collection

1. Edit the `aqua.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Aqua [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.:

   ```yaml
   instances:
     - url: http://your-aqua-instance.com
       api_user: "<API_USERNAME>"
       password: "<API_USER_PASSWORD>"
   ```

    Change the `api_user` and `password` parameter values and configure them for your environment.

2. [Restart the Agent][9].

#### Log collection

There are two types of logs generated by Aqua:

- Aqua audit logs
- Aqua enforcer logs

To collect Aqua audit logs:

1. Connect to your Aqua account
2. Go to the `Log Management` Section of the `Integration` Page
3. Activate the Webhook integration
4. Enable it and add the following endpoint: `{{< region-param key="http_endpoint" code="true" >}}/v1/input/<DATADOG_API_KEY>?ddsource=aqua`
   - Replace `<DATADOG_API_KEY>` by your [Datadog API Key][10].

For the Aqua Enforcer logs: **Available for Agent >6.0**

5. Collecting logs is disabled by default in the Datadog Agent. Enable it in your [daemonset configuration][11]:

   ```yaml
     # (...)
     env:
       # (...)
       - name: DD_LOGS_ENABLED
           value: "true"
       - name: DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CONTAINER_COLLECT_ALL
           value: "true"
     # (...)
   ```

    Make sure that the Docker socket is mounted to the Datadog Agent as done in [this manifest][12].

6. [Restart the Agent][9].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][13] and look for `aqua` under the Checks section.
