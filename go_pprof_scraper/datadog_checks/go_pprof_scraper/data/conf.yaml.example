## All options defined here are available to all instances.
#
init_config:

    ## @param service - string - optional
    ## Attach the tag `service:<SERVICE>` to every metric, event, and service check emitted by this integration.
    ##
    ## Additionally, this sets the default `service` for every log source.
    #
    # service: <SERVICE>

## Every instance is scheduled independently of the others.
#
instances:

  -
    ## @param env - string - optional - default: prod
    ## env tag to apply to uploaded profiles ("env:<ENV>")
    #
    # env: prod

    ## @param pprof_url - string - required
    ## URL of the /debug/pprof endpoint to collect
    #
    pprof_url: http://myservice:1234/debug/pprof/

    ## @param duration - integer - optional - default: 60
    ## Duration of profiles, in seconds
    #
    # duration: 30

    ## @param profiles - list of strings - optional
    ## List of profiles to collect. Valid options are "cpu", "heap", "mutex", "block", and "goroutine"
    #
    # profiles:
    #   - cpu
    #   - heap

    ## @param cumulative - boolean - optional - default: true
    ## Whether to collect heap, mutex, or block profiles as cumulative profiles
    ## since the program started. If false, requests those profiles over the
    ## period specified by "duration". The profiles will hold the difference
    ## between the samples at the beginning and end of profiling.
    ##
    ## For the heap profile, the in-use (also known as "live heap") samples
    ## may be negative if "cumulative" is false. This does not display
    ## accurately in the profile UI, so Datadog does not recommend setting
    ## "cumulative" to false.
    ##
    ## In order to use profile aggregation, "cumulative" must set to false.
    ## Note that setting "cumulative" to false will cause the profiled
    ## application to use more memory in order to compute the profiles.
    #
    # cumulative: true

    ## @param tags - list of strings - optional
    ## A list of tags to attach to every metric and service check emitted by this instance.
    ##
    ## Learn more about tagging at https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging
    #
    # tags:
    #   - <KEY_1>:<VALUE_1>
    #   - <KEY_2>:<VALUE_2>

    ## @param service - string - required
    ## Service name to tag on every profile uploaded for this instance.
    ##
    ## Overrides any `service` defined in the `init_config` section.
    #
    service: <SERVICE>

    ## @param min_collection_interval - number - optional - default: 1
    ## This changes the collection interval of the check. For more information, see:
    ## https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/#collection-interval
    ##
    ## This is a long-running check, and is intended to be started again as
    ## soon as it finishes. Setting this to a larger value will cause longer
    ## pauses between iterations of this check.
    ##
    ## If omitted, will default to 15 seconds.
    #
    min_collection_interval: 1

    ## @param empty_default_hostname - boolean - optional - default: false
    ## This forces the check to send metrics with no hostname.
    ##
    ## This is useful for cluster-level checks.
    #
    # empty_default_hostname: false

    ## @param metric_patterns - mapping - optional
    ## A mapping of metrics to include or exclude, with each entry being a regular expression.
    ##
    ## Metrics defined in `exclude` will take precedence in case of overlap.
    #
    # metric_patterns:
    #   include:
    #   - <INCLUDE_REGEX>
    #   exclude:
    #   - <EXCLUDE_REGEX>
