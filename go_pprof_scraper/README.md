# Agent Check: Go-pprof-scraper

## Overview

This check collects profiles from Go applications which expose the [`/debug/pprof`][1] endpoint.

**NOTE**: Prefer instrumenting services with the [dd-trace-go][12] profiling client library. The client library
offers better integration with other Datadog services, such as through [code hotspots and endpoint filtering][13].
Use this integration for services for which you do not control the source code.

**NOTE**: Using this integration results in billing for hosts under Datadog's [Continuous Profiler][10] service.
For more on Continuous Profiler billing, consult our [billing documentation][11].

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to install and configure this check for an Agent running on a host. For containerized environments, see the [Autodiscovery Integration Templates][3] for guidance on applying these instructions.

### Installation

If you are using an Agent version >= 7.21/6.21, follow the instructions below to install the `go_pprof_scraper` check on your host. See the dedicated Agent guide for [installing community integrations][14] to install checks with an [Agent version < v7.21/v6.21][15] or the [Docker Agent][16]:

1. [Download and launch the Datadog Agent][2].
2. Run the following command to install the integrations wheel with the Agent:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-go-pprof-scraper==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```
  You can find the latest version on the [Datadog Integrations Release Page][17]

   **Note**: If necessary, prepend `sudo -u dd-agent` to the install command.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `go_pprof_scraper.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Go performance data. See the [sample go_pprof_scraper.d/conf.yaml][4] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][5].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][6] and look for `go_pprof_scraper` under the Checks section.
