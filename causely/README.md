# Causely - Assure Continuous Application Reliability using Causal AI

## Overview


Our [Causal AI platform][1] automatically captures, represents and analyzes causality. We enable self-managed, resilient applications by bridging observability with automated orchestration.  Instead of constant noisy alerts, Causely tells you exactly what you need to know about all active and emerging application failures:

- Why did it happen?
- What was the root cause?
- How can it be fixed?

## What Causely offers:

### Assure Continuous Application Reliability
- Guarantee that KPIs, SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs are consistently met to maintain application reliability and performance.
### Improve Operational Efficiency
- Reduce labor, data, and tooling costs by focusing on faster Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and implementing efficient operational processes.
### Accelerate The Delivery Of Features & Innovations
- Enhance the speed and reliability of shipping new services and features to market, ensuring a competitive edge and meeting customer demands promptly.

## Setup

The Causely integration uses a [Datadog API key][2], which needs to be created by a Datadog admin.

To connect Datadog with Causely, create monitors in Datadog. Refer to Datadog's [Alerting documentation][3].

See the [Causely documentation][4] to learn how to configure the Causely integration for Datadog.
