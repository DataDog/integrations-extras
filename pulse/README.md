## Setup

To add Datadog as an alerting destination in Pulse, go to the **Events & Alerts** tab in you cluster's page, click **Add destinations**, and select **Datadog**.

Make sure the integration is enabled, then choose your Datadog region (e.g. US1), and paste your **Datadog API key** into the API Key field. Optionally, you can add tags separated by commas or spaces.

Select the alert severities you want to forward (Critical, Warning, and/or Informative), and click **Send test alert** if you want to verify it's working. The setup saves automatically - once the key is valid and at least one severity is selected, you're good to go.

## Uninstallation

To remove Datadog as an alerting destination in Pulse, go to the **Events & Alerts** tab in your cluster's page, scroll down to the Datadog card, and click the trash icon in the bottom right corner. 

That's it - the integration will be disabled and deleted immediately, and no alerts will be sent to Datadog anymore.

## Support

If you need help with the Datadog integration or anything else in Pulse, you can open a support ticket directly through the Pulse platform, or just send us an email at **[info@pulse.support]()**.
