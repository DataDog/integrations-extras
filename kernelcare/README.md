# Agent Check: kernelcare

## Overview

[KernelCare][1] is a live patching system that automatically applies security patches to Linux kernel vulnerabilities, with no reboots. It's used on over 500,000 servers, and has been used to patch servers running for 6+ years for Dell, Zoom, and other enterprise companies. It works with all major Linux distributions, such as RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Ubuntu, and interoperates with common vulnerability scanners, cloud monitoring tools, and patch management solutions.

This integration allows you to forward the Kernelcare metrics through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

The Kernelcare check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Kernelcare check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-kernelcare==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `kernelcare.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your kernelcare performance data. See the [sample kernelcare.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][9].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `kernelcare` under the Checks section.
