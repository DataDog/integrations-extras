# Agent Check: Syncthing

## Overview

Syncthing synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time. This integration allows you to monitor [Syncthing][1] using Datadog.

## Setup

The Syncthing check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Syncthing check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install the Syncthing check with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-syncthing==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `syncthing.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Syncthing [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample syncthing.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][9]

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `syncthing` under the Checks section.
