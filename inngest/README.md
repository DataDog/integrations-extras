# Inngest

## Overview

Inngest's durable functions replace queues, state management, and scheduling to enable developers to build reliable, AI-ready step functions faster - without touching infrastructure.

Send key metrics about your Inngest functions and their underlying steps directly to your Datadog account. This allows you to proactively identify errors or performance issues, right alongside the monitoring you use for the rest of your infrastructure.

## Setup

1. In Datadog, navigate to **Integrations**, select the Inngest tile, and click **Install Integration**.

2. Click **Connect Accounts** to start the authorization process. You will be redirected to Inngest to complete the setup.

3. After authorization, your Production environment will start sending metrics.

4. To enable additional environments, visit **Inngest Cloud → Integrations → Datadog**.
