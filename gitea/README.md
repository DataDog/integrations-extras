# Gitea Integration

## Overview

[Gitea][1] is a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go.

This integration monitors Gitea instances through the Datadog [Agent][2].

## Setup

### Prerequisite

Gitea doesn't expose its internal metrics by default. You need to enable the built-in HTTP server that exposes the metrics endpoint in your `app.ini` configuration file.

```ini
[metrics]
ENABLED = true
```

See the official [documentation][3] for more information.

### Installation

The Gitea integration is not included in the [Datadog Agent][4] package by default, it must be installed.

For Agent v7.36+, follow the instructions below to install the Gitea check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][5] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

```shell
datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-gitea==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
```

2. Configure your integration similar to Agent-based [integrations][6].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `gitea.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Gitea data. See the [sample gitea.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][8].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][9] and look for `gitea` under the Checks section.
