# Agent Check: Puma

## Overview

This check monitors [Puma][1] through the Datadog Agent with the Puma metrics endpoint provided by the [control and status][5] server.

## Setup

The Puma check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Puma check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-puma==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `puma.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Puma performance data. See the [sample puma.d/conf.yaml][9] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][10].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][11] and look for `puma` under the Checks section.
