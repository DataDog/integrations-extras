# UPSC Stats Collector Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from UPSD service through UPSC in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor UPS battery health and states
- Be notified about UPS failovers and events.

## Setup

The UPSC check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the UPSC check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-upsc==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `upsc.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][6] to start collecting your UPSC [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample upsc.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][8]

## Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][9] and look for `upsc` under the Checks section.
