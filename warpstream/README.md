## Overview

WarpStream is an Apache KafkaÂ® compatible data streaming platform built directly on top of object storage: no inter-AZ networking costs, no disks to manage, and infinitely scalable, all within your VPC.

The Datadog Agent collects many metrics from Warpstream.

Metrics are sent directly from the [WarpStream Agent][2] to Datadog's [DogStatsD][3].

## Setup

### Installation

All steps below are needed for the Warpstream integration to work properly. Before you begin, [install the Datadog Agent][3] version `>=6.17` or `>=7.17`.

### Configuration

There are two parts of the Warpstream integration:

- The Datadog Agent portion, which makes requests to a provided endpoint for Warpstream agent to report whether it can connect and is healthy.
- The Warpstream StatsD portion, where Warpstream Agent can be configured to send metrics to the Datadog Agent.

The Warpstream integration's [metrics](#metrics) come from both the Agent and StatsD portions.

#### Host

##### Configure Datadog Agent Warpstream integration

Configure the Warpstream check included in the [Datadog Agent][4] package to collect health metrics and service checks. This can be done by editing the `url` within the `warpstream.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory, to start collecting your Warpstream service checks. See the [sample warpstream.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.

Ensure that `url` matches your Warspstream Agent HTTP server (port 8080 by default).

##### Connect Warpstream Agent to DogStatsD

Start the agent with the flag `-enableDatadogMetrics` or set the environment variable `WARPSTREAM_ENABLE_DATADOG_METRICS` to `true`.

##### Restart Datadog Agent and Warpstream

1. [Restart the Agent][6].
2. Restart Warpstream agent to start sending your Warpstream metrics to the Agent DogStatsD endpoint.
