# Warpstream

## Overview

WarpStream is an Apache KafkaÂ® compatible data streaming platform built directly on top of object storage: no inter-AZ networking costs, no disks to manage, and infinitely scalable, all within your VPC. We target all kafka users who are willing to trade easier operability and lower cost against a slightly higher latency.


As the agents are deployed in your infra, this integration will provide you with as much observability as you want.
