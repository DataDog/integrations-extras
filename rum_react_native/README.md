# React Native Integration

## Overview

With the Datadog [React Native integration][1], you can spend less time triaging issues and more time releasing new features by:

- Debugging the root cause of slow performance issues and application crashes in third-party libraries, network requests, or large media files 
- Improving application responsiveness, setting up service level indicators (SLIs), and diagnosing issues with out-of-the-box dashboards, real-time metrics, and deobfuscated crash reports 
- Intelligently grouping high-volume application errors into a manageable set of unique issues

Correlate the impact of the user experience on your business by:

- Analyzing critical mobile user experience data such as screen engagement by demographics, version releases, or any custom attributes, to reach your business KPIs 
- Automatically correlating every user journey with a timeline of session events and attributes including ID, cellular activity, referral URL, and more 
- Understanding user behavior trends with customizable analytics and geographical maps

Monitor the end-to-end health of your React Native application by: 

- Pivoting from your user experience data to backend traces, runtime metrics, and logs for the complete context when investigating issues 
- Debugging crashes faster by unifying client-side and server-side metrics, traces, and logs
- Unifying full-stack monitoring in a single platform for frontend and backend teams

## Setup

### Collect RUM events 

To start collecting Real User Monitoring events from your application, see [React Native Monitoring][2]. 

### Collect traces 

Your React Native application automatically sends traces to Datadog.

### Collect logs 

To start forwarding your React Native application's logs to Datadog, see [React Native Log Collection][3].

Data Collected

### Metrics

The React Native integration does not include any metrics. To generate custom metrics from your RUM application, see [Generate Metrics][4].

### Events 

For more information about events and attributes, see [RUM React Native Data Collected][5].
