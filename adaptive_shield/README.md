## Overview
SaaS Apps like Office 365, Slack, Zoom, and Salesforce are vital to a business's day-to-day operations, but can often introduce new security challenges. Adaptive Shield's SaaS Security Posture Management solution (SSPM) features proactive, deep, continuous, and automated monitoring and management of business critical SaaS applications. By integrating with SaaS apps, Adaptive Shield enables security teams to gain control over their SaaS apps, allowing them to harden their security policies and reduce risks.

With the Adaptive Shield integration, you can track and monitor SaaS posture alerts, such as configuration drifts, integration failures, and security check degradations, as Datadog Events.
