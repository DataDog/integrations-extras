# Roku Integration

## Overview

With the Datadog [Roku integration][1], you can spend less time triaging issues and more time releasing new features by:

- Debugging the root cause of slow performance issues and application crashes, network requests, or large media files
- Improving application responsiveness, setting up service level indicators (SLIs), and diagnosing issues with out-of-the-box dashboards and real-time metrics
- Intelligently grouping high-volume application errors into a manageable set of unique issues

Correlate the impact of the user experience on your business by:

- Analyzing critical user experience data such as screen engagement by demographics, version releases, or any custom attributes, to reach your business KPIs
- Understanding user behavior trends with customizable analytics and geographical maps

Monitor the end-to-end health of your application by:

- Pivoting from your user experience data to backend traces, runtime metrics, and logs for the complete context when investigating issues
- Debugging crashes faster by unifying client-side and server-side metrics, traces, and logs
- Unifying full-stack monitoring in a single platform for frontend and backend teams

## Setup

### Collect RUM events

To start collecting Real User Monitoring events from your application, see [Roku Monitoring][2]. Additionally, you can [Connect RUM and Traces][3].
