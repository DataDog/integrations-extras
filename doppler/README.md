# Agent Check: Doppler

## Overview

[Doppler][1] is a secrets manager designed with both security and developer productivity in mind.
Doppler allows you to securely store secrets (for example: API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive values) and deliver them to your applications.

This integration sends Activity Logs from [Doppler][1] to Datadog, allowing you to monitor changes to your workplace.
This includes:

- Modifications to projects, environments, and secrets
- Changes to your team, including new members, role changes, and removals
- Changes to workplace settings, including integrations and security features

Doppler does not collect any data from your Datadog account.
