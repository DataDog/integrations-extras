# Agent Check: Cyral

## Overview

This check monitors a [Cyral][1] MySQL sidecar through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

The Cyral check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Cyral check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-cyral==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `cyral.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your cyral performance data. See the [sample cyral.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
     # url of the metrics endpoint of prometheus
     - prometheus_url: http://localhost:9018/metrics
    ```

2. [Restart the Agent][9].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `cyral` under the Checks section.

## Data Collected

### Metrics

See [metadata.csv][11] for a list of metrics provided by this check.

### Service Checks

Cyral does not include any service checks.

### Events

Cyral does not include any events.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot connect

```text
    cyral
    -------
      - instance #0 [ERROR]: "('Connection aborted.', error(111, 'Connection refused'))"
      - Collected 0 metrics, 0 events & 0 service check
```

Check that the `url` in `cyral.yaml` is correct.
