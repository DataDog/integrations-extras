# Agent Check: Speedtest

## Overview

This check monitors [Speedtest][1] through the Datadog Agent.

## Setup

The Speedtest check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Speedtest check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-speedtest==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

**Note**: For all hosts, you need to install the [Speedtest CLI][1] and accept the agreement as the Datadog Agent user prior to use, for example: `sudo -u dd-agent speedtest`.

### Configuration

1. Edit the `speedtest.d/conf.yaml` file, in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's configuration directory to start collecting your Speedtest performance data. See the [sample speedtest.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][9].

### Validation

Run the [Agent's status subcommand][10] and look for `speedtest` under the Checks section.
