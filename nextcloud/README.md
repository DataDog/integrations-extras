# Agent Check: Nextcloud

## Overview

This check monitors [Nextcloud][1].

## Setup

The Nextcloud check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Nextcloud check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-nextcloud==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `nextcloud.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][7] to start collecting your Nextcloud [metrics](#metrics). See the [sample nextcloud.d/conf.yaml][8] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][9]

### Validation
