# EventStore Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from EventStore in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor EventStore queues
* Capture all available metrics within the following API endpoints: stats, node info, non-transient projections, subscriptions, cluster gossip (the list of endpoints to scrape is configurable)

## Setup

The EventStore check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the EventStore check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-eventstore==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `eventstore.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][6] to start collecting your EventStore [metrics](#metrics).
   See the [sample eventstore.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][8].

### Validation

[Run the Agent's status subcommand][9] and look for `eventstore` under the Checks section.

## Compatibility

The check is compatible with all major platforms.

## Data Collected
